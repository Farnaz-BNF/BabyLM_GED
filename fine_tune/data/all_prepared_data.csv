"Nevertheless, I lost my concentration to my studies and I spent the money on entertainment.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"In addition to this, some concert halls were too small to host all the people who were there for the occasion and, personally speaking, I think the show could be done at the open air next year, so that the music would also create a fantastic atmosphere all around.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I would also like to know how much money I will get from you for these two weeks because I would like to spend some money for clothes.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
It was hard but also fun work. You should try to get some experience during such a concert. You would not regret it.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
For the past four years I have been playing tennis and I have also done some courses about painting.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I would appreciate it if I could travel on July because my school gives me two weeks' summer holiday.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"You should pick only six countries, so it won't be very busy and another reason is that the concert hall is too small so that the people couldn't even dance in classical concerts.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
You could have let us get acquainted to more cultures by inviting guests from some other countries too.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"It was really a reasonably priced weekend for me, but you should also introduce new activities like competitions on singing songs or drawing a portrait next year.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

I write to you because last Friday I had a very disappointing evening in your theatre.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
So we returned in the evening and we waited 45 minutes until the beginning of the show!,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"Like I have already told you, instead of being the perfect evening, it was the worst I ever had.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"First, the actors that the Circle theatre publicised in their tickets for Over the Rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"For the reasons I have already explained, I would like to ask you if I can have my money back, but this is not the most important thing to me, because I want your theatre to change and become the best.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

Most students who were interviewed suggested having a speaking part of the lesson that is to be on film.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

How are you? I'm fine. Soon I'll have my holiday and I look forward for that but now I have a lot of exams and if I want to pass them I have to learn a lot.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We have a good and rich sponsor. That's why we could buy a lot of different materials with different colours and we tried to be polite with actors even if they didn't want to wear that piece of clothing which we thought was most suitable to their style.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We always explained things to them and at the end they agreed with us.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"It is a really great pleasure going in and out from different shops, trying on a variety of clothes and shoes, and finally going back home with dozens of bags in your hands.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"Furthermore, for the activities I want to select Tennis and Basketball because I have been playing tennis since I was young and basketball because I played for the team in my college like the captain.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Another good thing was that all the people wanted to be in your place and they were very jealous about me.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Suppose you go shopping with your girlfriend, that means that you will have to spend hours walking behind her from one shop to another and during the time that she is trying the items on, you have to bear the odds faces of the other women looking at you as if you were an alien into their territory.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"There is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself into the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day - off you have to buy something you like.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I'm the winner of the first prize in your competition and I'm writing to you to give you some information which was requested for you.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Otherwise shopping is not always enjoyable. You can spend hours and hours shopping and not find what you are looking for, perhaps because it is not in your size or the colour that you like, or just nothing is suitable to you.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
First of all I would like to travel on July because I will have finished my exams by the end of June.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I will not be able to travel on August because I have found a job for that month.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
In swimming I won the first prize of a local competition.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

This was another disappointing thing of that evening.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I agree with shopping is not always enjoyable.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"Then the concert started, I was called from one of the staff for help, finally I could get into the stadium.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I have recently been on a holiday in London.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Of course nobody knows the answer and maybe we should be happy for that.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I gave it some thought the other day and when I think about future - clothing I can't take my mind from plastic fabrics.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Since that Saturday evening I have never spoken with Pat.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"To answer your first question, I would like to travel on July if it's possible, because I'll be on holiday and because a friend would be able to come with me at that time of the year.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competition of two weeks at Camp California in the U.S.A.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
The motorbike club of our town organized a pop concert.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"I also would prefer to sleep into tents, which are more comfortable, and, because I have been doing lots of camping, I am quite used to this kind of accommodation.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"If you are interested in the question, you will be interested by this article.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"For example at work, we look on the computer screen all day, sending e - mail to the other side of the world, doing some research etc.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

The major problem for the industrial cities is to deal with the bad effects of pollution in the environment.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We are too dependent at technology today.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"Three years passed and, as is normal between friends, she knew a lot of things about them, like her friends knew a lot about her",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Of course, these new materials won't be so harmful for our health as today's nylon and other things like that.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

I am writing to complain about the musical which was performed by The Circle Theatre last week.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I saw the performance and it was not like it was described in the advertisement I read in the local newspaper.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
So I would be grateful if you paid for a full refund of the money I spent in the tickets.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Modern technology affects the way things are done and many aspects in my life, and it has some advantages as well as some disadvantages.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Another advantage is that, for example, satellite television, which is an example of modern technology, keeps me informed about what is happening on the whole world.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
It would not only emphasize the sharp contrast with this and the classroom atmosphere but also show how they are as young people.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"I think modern technology hasn't changed my life a lot, but it has in some things : I work with music and with graphic design too, and computers help me a lot in these things.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

In the advertisement you write that it's the perfect evening out but all these problems made my evening in the show very unpleasant.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"First at all, it is a pleasure to say that the programme which you so kindly have prepared is very interesting, especially the visit to the National Art Gallery on Wednesday.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"It gets enormously unbearable in hot summer days, when the temperature increases.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
As you have written at the advertisement : it is London's newest and best musical show.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Danny Brook didn't act at the performance, there was another, unknown, actor.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"But why do you mention about the restaurant at the advertisement, if it is closed?",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
It spoilt all my impression about London.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"For example, now women don't spend a lot of time at the kitchen, preparing the meal or washing dishes.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"If I need to say something important to my parents or my friends, or if something terrible has happened with me, I do not have to run somewhere to find a telephone box.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Finally, I can say that modern technology really helps people at their work.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We stayed in a host family in a suburb of the city.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"If you have not reached your majority you aren't allowed to drink or smoke, or, even worse, to go in a bar.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"So one night Pat, who was 5 years older than I, and I decided to go in a bar even if we knew I wasn't allowed in.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We went at the bar and asked for an alcoholic drink.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Lack of time made me go at the evening show.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"And unfortunately again, from some reason, it was delayed until quarter past eight.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
At the end of the advertisement I noticed it said something of a perfect evening out.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Mr manager, I warn you, if I don't get my money back, we'll meet at court.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Looking back in the past, I can see how big a difference there is between the life of my grandparents and mine.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

I am writing in behalf of my classmates about the programme you have organised for us.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

Therefore I would like to improve my skills and knowledge about these subjects during my holiday.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Despite knowing the difficulty we do not avoid shopping in those days.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"On the other hand, some companies offer special services, such as sending your order with post or taking it on the telephone.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"However, we'd like to ask about London Fashion and Leisure Show that we've seen an advertisement for on this week's college newspaper. We would appreciate it if you could give us a chance to go there while we are visiting London.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
But the worst thing was that after the show the restaurant of the theatre was closed and so I had to go to another place to have dinner.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
The changes brought by modern technology are so important that today no one can live without this technology or with a part of it.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I am writing to complain about your musical show. I am not really satisfied about it.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Firstly, I hoped to have a relaxing evening with your show but that didn't happen.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"First of all, as you know, lots of technology has advanced since a few years.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We started at 7 pm to let them in the concert area.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"After that day, I've never stayed at a log cabin.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"- As far as accommodation is concerned, I would prefer the log cabin due to the fact that I am not a teenager any more and crawling in and out of a tent has become awkward to me.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I am also writing to make a suggestion and to give you my opinion for next year's festival.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I really look forward to taking part at Camp California.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"If I had the choice, I would never go shopping to the big supermarkets.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"What is more, our friends didn't want to talk with us.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We tried to survive there without returning on land - to our town.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
There was no light during night so we had to find some wood to make a fire.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
We found the solution of this desperate situation - to say nothing to anybody.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"In addition we are fascinated in their marriages, children, holidays etc.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
To have a private life is the natural desire of everyone and the famous film stars and politicians have a right for one.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
On my opinion this is the worst thing that can ever happen.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"I start my first job on August 1st, that's why I must travel on July.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
But there are also a lot of clubs and activities that form part in the daily life of pupils.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
That's why they both have to be taken in account in the video we will make.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
but I think we must create a good picture of the school with sport.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I have already thought about a change of the programme.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"The only problem is that the show is going to take place on Tuesday 14th March, so I'm wondering if you can make some changes in your programme.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I think that everyone should think not just about the positive side with technology but also the negative.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Consequently, I ask for my money back, and I will obviously not go back in the Circle Theatre.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"However, she was interested, and decided to lead her own enquiry about this case.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

Why do you put it on the paper then?,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

We went to the toilet and ate something to the snack bar.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

Nowadays we think in modern technology as something usual in our lives.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"For instance with the arrival of the Internet, the new digital television and the researchers in medicine, we are discovering how we can change our lives with only the press of a button, or look for something new with only thinking about it... we realize that the new technology has just begun to advance, and it is likely in a few years we will be very advanced in this way.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Finally, I just want to say that the perfect evening that the advertisement promised and that we all wanted turned out to be regrettable for the wasted money.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

I think the concert has changed me so much. Now I have my aim about what I should do in my life.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
What I decided to do was to get into the house by climbing up the roof because I knew one of the windows was unlocked.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"I must say though, I would have to travel on July because it's the summer holidays for schools and I would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Climbing would be my second option, but for this I'm afraid I would need some instruction for I've only done it a few times.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"Well, you want to know what I did in the concert?",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"I know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what I thought when I was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun that expected.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"To sum up, there are many other discoveries related with modern technology which affect my daily life.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"First of all, I want to inform you that I would like to travel only in July, because in California at that time of the year it is very hot and I prefer going on summer to going in winter or during it other season, because I can do lots of activities that in winter it would be impossible to do.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

Another example is the computer. I don't have to watch television or read a newspaper because I can get the news by using the Internet in the computer.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Therefore my daily life will change to bad ways or goods ways. It depends on how I use the technology.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
The show is in 14th March on Tuesday.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
It is in the Central Exhibition Hall and it is free to students.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Whatever we need we order from the computer and someone will bring it.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
I was working helping to build and dismantle the stage. Sometimes I had to check the sound by saying something on the microphone. That was my chance and I always pretended to be a singer and that I sang in a duet with the vocalist of the group. It was such great fun!,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Thank you very much for your letter informing me that I have won the competition and that I have got the prize for a two week holiday at Camp California in the USA.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing

It wasn't really a perfect evening like you promised on your flyer.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Modern technology also allows you to go into the Internet to get any information you need.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
Another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because they watch TV or play or work with the Computer and don't see each other anymore because they don't have to.,PREP,Preposition_Replacing
"One of the reasons I went to see that particular show was the starring actor, announced in the ad to be Danny Brook, but when the show actually started, with forty - five minutes' delay, I realized that Danny Brook was not in the play.",PREP,Preposition_Replacing

"Finally, I would like to ask some questions such as clothes and money.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
It provides you all the information you want.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

"We all like going out to the shops, and spending hours looking all sorts of products and comparing the prices, until we decide which one is the most suitable for us.",PREP,Preposition_Missing

"The best way is they, the famous stars and the journalists, compromise and respect each other's rights.",PREP,Preposition_Missing

I look forward to hearing you as soon as possible.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
I look forward to joining the camp. I've always wanted to go the U.S.A. It must be a good chance to join the camp.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

I would also like to suggest you try and make more plays and films available next year.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
Another problem - we were very hungry that evening because the show was delayed 45 minutes!,PREP,Preposition_Missing
"At that time I was lucky and also, I would like to recommend it other friends.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
"But most teachers consult with their parents, so if they behave wrongly it is true teachers call their parents.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
I am looking forward to hearing you as soon as possible.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
We thought that we could change the programme this way : we could go to the Science Museum Wednesday afternoon instead of Tuesday.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

"Many times we buy things that, actually, we don't need and, sometimes you are surprised when you check the balance of your bank account and then you need to cut down your expenses for 2 months.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
I will choose for my activities tennis and swimming. I'm good at tennis because I have played since 1990 and I love it and I chose swimming because I like to swim and I've been two competitions and I won both.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
"I would like to ask you for money and clothes because my parents are travelling and it is impossible for me to get any money because my sister doesn't want me to go because I'm only 14, but when I get there I promise to return you all the money because I don't have any cash at the moment.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
"If you have children, you will know very well when you are busy doing something and the children see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes they even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
I am writing you because I would like to provide the information that you ask for.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

Thank you very much for your nice letter which informed me I have won first prize in your competition.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

"From the 10 options that I have to choose I will choose two, climbing, which I have been doing for three years because I know it by heart, and swimming which I have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
But it was completely different what I had expected.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

"The book is very easy to read, but if you don't have time I recommend listening the programme.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
"Finally, I helped them and in return I had a good experience as well as enjoying listening the music.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
We have thought buying a CD or a book.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
In particular young people's lives have been very difficult the last few years.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
Their family could explain them how they avoid things.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
"On the other hand, friends are not suitable doing this.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
The way which the family comes in contact with the members so easily is love.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
"Modern technology is used all the time at home, at school or working.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
"And of these circumstances, I would like to have a part of my money back.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
I walked first with Pat and two of my friends.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

"I am grateful you for offering a well - organised programme, especially, the London fashion and leisure show which is difficult for us to take part in.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
The students mentioned that it would be very interesting to show the English lesson because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to find out our English course.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

"Regarding the accommodation, I would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me my holidays with my family.",PREP,Preposition_Missing

But it has advantages as well disadvantages.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
I was very disappointed it.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
If you could reply my letter by the 28th of June I'd be grateful because I have to give information about my holiday dates to my company.,PREP,Preposition_Missing

May I ask you to give me some more information about the matters that I have asked you?,PREP,Preposition_Missing

"The last ten years computers have entered almost every house, especially in rich countries.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
"I keep that in my mind, ever!",PREP,Preposition_Missing
"But I don't think we should film breaks, because in my opinion everyone knows what breaks are and what students do during them.",PREP,Preposition_Missing
I'm writing you because I have an important thing to tell you.,PREP,Preposition_Missing
